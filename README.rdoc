= ruby-tmdb

ruby-tmdb is an ActiveRecord-style API wrapper for {TheMovieDB.org (TMDb)}[http://www.themoviedb.org/]. ruby-tmdb is designed to streamline common tasks associated with finding information about movies and cast members.

=== Examples

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'ruby-tmdb'

  # setup your API key
  Tmdb.api_key = "t478f8de5776c799de5a"

  # setup your default language
  Tmdb.default_language = "en"

  @movie = TmdbMovie.find(:title => "Iron Man", :limit => 1)
  # => <OpenStruct>

  @movie.name
  # => "Iron Man"

  @movie.posters.length
  # => 12

  @movie.posters.first.data
  # => [binary blob representing JPEG]

=== Installation

For ease of use ruby-tmdb is packaged as a Rubygem. Installing it is as simple as:

  gem install ruby-tmdb

=== Usage

There are 3 main methods you can use to get information about movies and cast members:

==== TmdbMovie.find([:id, :imdb, :title, :limit, :expand_results, :language])

Find information about an individual movie, or a set of movies that share a similar title, eg:

  TmdbMovie.find(:title => "fight club", :limit => 10, :expand_results => true, :language => "en")

Parameters:

[:id]              Specifies an individual movie via it's TMDb id
[:title]           Specifies a query string to look for in the movie titles
[:imdb]            Specifies an individual movie via it's IMDB id
[:limit]           Specifies the maximum number of results to be returned
[:expand_results]  The TMDb API by default returns only partial info for any API method that can return multiple results. When :expand_results is set to true ruby-tmdb automatically makes extra API calls to fetch the full information for each item. This can result in *very* slow requests though. If you only need basic information for a search listing then set this to false. Defaults to 'true'.
[:language]        Allows you to override the default API language on a per-query basis.

You must supply at least one of :id, :title, or :imdb. All other parameters are optional.

==== TmdbMovie.browse([query_options],[:language, :expand_results])

Find information about a set of movies grouped by one or more defined criteria, eg:

  TmdbMovie.browse(:order_by => "rating", :order => "desc", :genres => 18, :min_votes => 5, :page => 1, :per_page => 10, :language => "en", :expand_results => true)

Parameters:

[query_options]    These are defined by the TMDB.org API, for more info on which options are available please have a look at the {'browse' API documentation}[http://api.themoviedb.org/2.1/methods/Movie.browse]
[:expand_results]  See TmdbMovie
[:language]        See TmdbMovie

==== TmdbCast.find([:id, :name, :limit, :expand_results, :language])

Find information about an individual cast member, or a set of cast members sharing similar names, eg:

  TmdbCast.find( :id => 123, :name => "Brad", :limit => 1, :expand_results => true, :language => "fr")

[:id]              Specifies an individual cast member via their TMDb id
[:name]            Specifies a query string to look for in the cast names
[:limit]           See TmdbMovie
[:expand_results]  See TmdbMovie
[:language]        See TmdbMovie

You must supply at least one of :id or :name. All other parameters are optional.


=== Usage Examples

Find all movies whose titles match a given string:

  @movies = TmdbMovie.find(:title => 'Iron Man')

Find the movie most likely to be associated with a given title:

  @movie = TmdbMovie.find(:title => 'Sin City', :limit => 1)

Find a single movie by it's TMDb ID:

  @movie = TmdbMovie.find(:id => 187)

Find a single movie by it's IMDB ID:

  @movie = TmdbMovie.find(:imdb => 'tt0401792')

Find all cast members whose names match a given string:

  @actors = TmdbCast.find(:name => 'Fred')

Find an individual cast member via their TMDb ID:

  @actor = TmdbCast.find(:id => 101)

Get the info for a movie in French:

  @movie = TmdbMovie.find(:title => 'Sin City', :limit => 1, :language => "fr")


=== Item information

To find out more about the information each object offers on retrieved items have a look at the {TMDb API Docs}[http://api.themoviedb.org/2.1]. For the most accurate information about the information available have a look at the data directly through ruby-tmdb by calling @item.raw_data.inspect
